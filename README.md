Hi! Welcome to this front-end challenge.
This project is a simple implementation of a static SPA to show products and
build a wishlist.
You are tasked to complete as many of the requirements below as possible by changing the code as you see fit.

## Setup

To run this project locally, you'll need a local server serving the project pages at localhost. We recommend the steps below to setup a simple local server in your machine. But you can use whatever local server you are most comfortable with.
 - Install and configure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your machine
 - Install the `http-server` package globally
    ```
    npm install http-server -g
    ```
 - Run the http-server in the project folder
    ```
    http-server
    ```
 - You now should be able to access the project at [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1:8080)
