# br-dtc-hiring-challenge-front

Hi! Congratulations on advancing to the front-end challenge.
The challenge will consist of an 1-hour pair coding scenario of a simple implementation of a static SPA to show products and build a wishlist.
Additional time has been reserved for questions. During this time, we will be evaluating your problem-solving skills as well as communication skills with the team.
You will be tasked to complete as many of the requirements below as possible by changing the code as you see fit.

## Setup

The project uses html, css, javascript and jquery.
You can run the project on any setup you are more comfortable with. In the case you do not have setup in place, we recommend you to follow these instructions.

To run this project locally, you'll need a local server serving the project pages at localhost. We recommend the steps below to setup a simple local server in your machine. But you can use whatever local server you are most comfortable with.
 - Install and configure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your machine
 - Install the `http-server` package globally
    ```
    npm install http-server -g
    ```
 - Run the http-server in the project folder
    ```
    http-server
    ```
 - With these steps, you hopefullyasda have a local server to run your code and live reload it once the code is saved. If you add an index.html in the current folder, you should be able to see it on the address [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## Project Requirements:

The challenge will have some example code that can be used for reference while solving the task at hand. This code will be presented in form of implemented features. Your task will be to complete the missing ones, as follows:
